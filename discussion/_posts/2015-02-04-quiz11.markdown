### Concepts
1. How many columns are in the table created by the following query? How many tables are being joined?  
   `select x.a, y.a, b from x, y where x.a = y.a;`  
2. If you join a table with n rows with a table with m rows, how many rows are in the output table?  
3. By default, aggregate functions perform some operation over all rows of the table. `GROUP BY` allows us to do what?   
4. How do we filter rows before aggregation? How do we filter rows after aggregation?
