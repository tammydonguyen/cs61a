## What would Python print?

    from operator import sub

    this = lambda a, b : lambda c: a(b, c)
    d = 30

    def that(e, f):
        if e and f:
            e, d = f(sub, e)(5), e
        else:
            print(e)
            d = 20
        def this(g):
           return lambda : print(g(d, e))
        return this

The code above is loaded into the Python interpreter. What would the following lines output? Assume they are entered one after the other in the same environment. If there is no output, leave the space blank. If the code causes an error, write Error and describe in a few words what caused it. 
   
<pre><code>>>> this(sub, d)()
<span class="solution">Error, second function call missing an argument</span>
>>> this(print, 40)(d)
<span class="solution">40 30</span>
>>> this(lambda x, y : y, d)(20)
<span class="solution">20</span>
>>> that(d, 0)(sub)
<span class="solution">30<br><\function ...></span>
>>> other = that(10, this)(print)
<span class="solution"></span>
>>> other() 
<span class="solution">10 5<br>None</span></code></pre>
