### Concepts
1. What is the difference between an instance attribute and a class attribute?  
2. What is `self` assigned to during a method call?  
3. **(T/F)** A class that inherits another class is not allowed to create new attributes or methods of the same names as the superclass.  
4. **(T/F)** The nonlocal statement allows you to access variables in parent frames.  
5. **(T/F)** The nonlocal statement does not allow to change global variables.

<blockquote class="solution">
1. An instance attribute is specific to a single instance of a class and does not affect other instances; these must be accessed using dot notation on an instance. A class attribute is shared among all instances; these can be accessed using dot notation on either a class or an instance (unless that instance has an instance attribute of the same name).<br/>
2. <code>self</code> is assigned to the instance that is making the method call. For <code>__init__</code>, since we don't (usually) call it on an instance, <code>self</code> is assigned to the newly created instance. <br/>
3. False. Subclasses may <b>override</b> methods (must redefine using the same signature) and attributes. <br/>
4. False. By default we can already access variables in parent frames. <code>nonlocal</code> allows us to <i>modify</i> these variables. <br/>
5. True. You can never modify glocal variables.

### WWPP  
Take a look at the two classes below and figure out what Python would output. Try drawing out a diagram to keep track of changing attributes!
{% highlight python %}
class Random:
    x = 0

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        Random.x = x
        self.x = y

    def foo(self):
        return Random.x + self.x

class Randomer(Random):
    x = 3

    def bar(self, y):
        self.x = y
        return self.foo()
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
>>> lol = Random(2, 3)
>>> wtf = Randomer(4, 5)
>>> lol.x

>>> lol.y

>>> Random.x

>>> wtf.bar(10)

>>> wtf.x

>>> Random.foo(lol)

>>> lol.bar(1000000)

{% endhighlight %}
