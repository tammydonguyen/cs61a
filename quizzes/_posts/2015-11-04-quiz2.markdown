[Environments](http://cs61a.org/assets/slides/05_6pp.pdf)

### Question 1 

Name the higher order function(s) in the code below and tell why they are higher order

{% highlight python %}
def foo(g, x):
    def baz(y):
        return g(x, y)
    z = baz
    return z

def bar():
    return baz
{% endhighlight %}

### Question 2

{% highlight python %}
def decrement(x):
    return x - 1

def half(x):
    return x // 2

def decrease_to_one(f, n):
    i = 0
    while n > 1:
        n = f(n)
        i += 1
    return i
{% endhighlight %}


How many call frames are opened if you call `decrease_to_one(decrement, 5)`? What about `decrease_to_one(half, 8)`?

### Question 3

What is the first step to evaluate an **assignment statement**? What about a **call expression**?
